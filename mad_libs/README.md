# Mad Libs Java Program Instructions

## 1. Add a Program Description Comment
Write a comment at the top of your code that describes the program. Include:
- A brief summary of what the program does
- Your name as the author
- The current date

## 2. Review the `story` Variable
The `story` variable holds the full text of your mad lib.  
Make sure all the other required variables are declared and initialized **before** the code compiles.

## 3. Create a Protagonist
Declare a `String` variable named `name1` to store the name of the main character.

## 4. Add Three Adjectives
Declare three `String` variables:
- `adjective1`
- `adjective2`
- `adjective3`  
  Each should store a different descriptive word.

## 5. Add One Verb
Declare a `String` variable called `verb1` to store a verb.

## 6. Add Six Nouns
Declare six `String` variables:
- `noun1`
- `noun2`
- `noun3`
- `noun4`
- `noun5`
- `noun6`  
  Initialize each with one of your favorite nouns.

## 7. Add Another Character
Declare a `String` variable named `name2` and assign it another name to be used as a character.

## 8. Add a Number
Declare an `int` variable called `number` and assign it a whole number of your choice.

## 9. Add a Place
Declare a `String` variable named `place1` and assign it any place (e.g., a city, country, planet, etc.).

## 10. Save and Compile
Ensure all variables are initialized and save your file.  
Check that the program compiles without any errors.

## 11. Print the Story
Use `System.out.println()` to print the `story` variable to the console.

## 12. Hide the Story and Share
- Add whitespace or scroll the code so the `story` variable is hidden.
- Ask a friend to fill in the declared variables with their own choices.
- Run the code to generate a new mad lib story!

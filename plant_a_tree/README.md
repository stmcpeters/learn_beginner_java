# ðŸŒ³ Java Tree Project Instructions

We're starting with a blank Java file named `Tree.java`.

## 1. Define the Class

- Create a class named `Tree` that follows Java naming conventions.

## 2. Add the `main()` Method

- The program will produce an error without a `main()` method.
- Define the `main()` method inside the curly braces of the `Tree` class.

## 3. Write a Comment in `main()`

- Add a comment that describes the task the method will perform.
- You can use either single-line or multi-line comment syntax.

## 4. Print Your Introduction

- Below the comment, add a statement to introduce yourself.
- When you run the code, this message should be printed to the screen.

## 5. Print the Project Goal

- Use another statement to describe the project goal (e.g., planting a tree).

## 6. Print the Tree

- Use multiple print statements to draw the tree line by line.
- Each line should be output using a separate statement.

## 7. Experiment With Different Trees

- Try out different tree designs.
- Have fun and be creative with your output!

# Math Magic Java Program Instructions

## 1. Declare `myNumber`
Create an `int` variable named `myNumber` and set it to any integer **except 0**.

## 2. Document the Original Number
Write a comment in your program to note that `myNumber` will be referred to as the *original number* throughout the program.

## 3. Step One
Create an `int` variable named `stepOne` and set it equal to `myNumber` multiplied by itself.

## 4. Step Two
Create an `int` variable named `stepTwo` and set it equal to `stepOne` plus `myNumber`.

## 5. Step Three
Create an `int` variable named `stepThree` and set it equal to `stepTwo` divided by `myNumber`.

## 6. Step Four
Create an `int` variable named `stepFour` and set it equal to `stepThree` plus 17.

## 7. Step Five
Create an `int` variable named `stepFive` and set it equal to `stepFour` minus `myNumber`.

## 8. Step Six
Create an `int` variable named `stepSix` and set it equal to `stepFive` divided by 6.

## 9. Print the Result
Use `System.out.println()` to print the value of `stepSix`.  
Save and run your code.

What number gets printed to the console?

## 10. Try a Different Number
Change the value of `myNumber` to a different integer within the allowed range.  
Run the program again.  
Is the output still the same?

It’s math magic!

> ⚠️ **Note:** Only use integer values between **-46,341** and **46,340** (inclusive).  
> Using numbers outside this range may cause overflow in `stepOne`, leading to incorrect results.

## 11. Bonus Challenge: Use Two Variables Only
Recreate this entire program using just two variables:
- `myNumber`
- `magicNumber`

Use **compound assignment operators** (e.g., `+=`, `*=`, `/=`) to transform `magicNumber` throughout the steps.

# Continents – Java Project Instructions

## Setting up

1. Let’s create a skeleton for the program. Add:

    ```java
    public class Continents {

      public static void main(String[] args) {

      }

    }
    ```

2. Write a comment near the top of the program that describes what the program does.

3. Create an `int` variable called `continent` and set it equal to `4`.

## Write a Switch Statement

4. Create a `switch` statement that will switch based on the value of `continent`.

5. Inside of the `switch` statement, add a case that will run when the value of `continent` is `1`.

6. When the value of `continent` is `1`, print out:
    ```
    North America: Mexico City, Mexico
    ```

7. Make sure the next line exits out of the case using `break`.

8. Add another case that will run when the value of `continent` is `2`. When this value is met, print out:
    ```
    South America: Sao Paulo, Brazil
    ```

9. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.

10. Add another case that will run when the value of `continent` is `3`. When this value is met, print out:
    ```
    Europe: Moscow, Russia
    ```

11. Add `break` to exit the case.

12. Add another case that will run when the value of `continent` is `4`. When this value is met, print out:
    ```
    Africa: Lagos, Nigeria
    ```

13. Add `break` to exit the case.

14. Add another case that will run when the value of `continent` is `5`. When this value is met, print out:
    ```
    Asia: Shanghai, China
    ```

15. Add `break` to exit the case.

16. Add another case that will run when the value of `continent` is `6`. When this value is met, print out:
    ```
    Australia: Sydney, Australia
    ```

17. Add `break` to exit the case.

18. Add another case that will run when the value of `continent` is `7`. When this value is met, print out:
    ```
    Antarctica: McMurdo Station, US
    ```

19. Add `break` to exit the case.

20. Add the `default` case. The default case should print out:
    ```
    Undefined continent!
    ```

21. Add `break` to exit the case.

## Final Result

- If the program is written correctly, your output should be:
    ```
    Africa: Lagos, Nigeria
    ```

## Great work!

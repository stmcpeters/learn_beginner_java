## FizzBuzz Instructions

### 2. Start by creating a skeleton for the program

- Create a `FizzBuzz` class.  
- Inside `FizzBuzz`, build an empty `main()` method.

### 3. Outputting Numbers from 1 to 100

How do we output all the numbers from 1 to 100?

Well, we could write `System.out.println()` 100 times back to back, but that’s no fun. What else can we do?

That’s right! A `for` loop!

- Write a `for` loop that starts at 1 and iterates to 100.

For multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number.
For the multiples of 5, print Buzz.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.

### 4. Inside the `for` loop

- Output the counter `i`.

---

### 5. Run your code

- Does it print every number between 1 and 100?
